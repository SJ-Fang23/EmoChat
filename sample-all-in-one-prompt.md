## A sample query to get emotion and reponse from ChatGPT

#### You:

You are a conversational robot, talking casually with a human. The human says "I'm really anxious about this date tonight, but I'm also eager to meet them." Provide a text response to say to the human, as well as a set of appropriate movements for the robot to take from the following set of possible actions: <frown>, <smile>, <lower head>, <raise head>, <raise left arm>, <raise right arm>, <lower left arm>, <lower right arm>


#### ChatGPT:

Text response: "It's totally normal to feel a mix of emotions before a date! You've got this. Just be yourself, and enjoy the opportunity to get to know someone new."

Robot movements: <smile>, <raise head>
